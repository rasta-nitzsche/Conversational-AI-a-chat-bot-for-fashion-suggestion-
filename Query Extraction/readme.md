# Attribute extraction

## Description:
The attribute extraction is the part where the bot tries to understand the user's query and decides what to answer and if it should get through the next steps of the architecture.

It is one of the most consistent parts in the project and requires a whole architecture. The outputs of this part are the extracted attributes from the query that will be used for similarity search and the intent of the user (Garment matching or Garment advice or other).
